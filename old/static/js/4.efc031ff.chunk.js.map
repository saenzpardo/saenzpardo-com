I recall my 2nd grade teacher not understanding how to start the program and I would\nget the machine loaded up and the game started.  I started learning a bit here and there about code.  Mostly out of curiousity\nor to make a small change or modification to something.  I wanted to know how things worked and I wanted to make them work\ndifferently.  I found myself in a career that was monotonous at the same time I was playing with Arduino devices.  I wanted to\ncreate my own programs, but I lacked knowledge and didn’t want to follow online tutorials everytime I wanted to make an LED\nlight up.  I found my local community college was offering a class in C# and decided to give it a go!

I feel like I’m not very good at coding.  I still find myself looking up the most rudimentary algorithms.  I attribute\nthat to my lack of ability to master any single language before moving onto another.  First there was C#, then Python, C# again,\noh and now you need to take a class on Java…next semester is Intro to WebDev so you should learn some JavaScript (not needed,\nbut more interesting than HTML), wait what’s React?? Angular!?! no…let’s stick with react.  Angular looks like a bitch… but\nwhat about .NET?? Oh waint, I’m really going to need SQL! or maybe NoSQL…Use case isn’t really clear at this point, so I’m not\nsure…You get the idea.  It’s tough to just learn one language when you can’t do much with just that language.  You need an\nentire briefcase full of tools to create anything of value it seems!  I have a very intelligent friend that codes for a living\neveryday.  I’ll send him snippets of projects that I’m sure seem laughable and elementary, but he’s a good friend and is always\nvery clear and concise when responding to my questions.  If we lived closer together I’d make him my mentor.  But I’m at the mercy\nof my local community college and online tutorials.
